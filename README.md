A couple of simple Python scripts to request recurrent data from the Bitsight API. 
- Monthly chart, comparing the rating to a previous time of measurement (one month prior)
- Weekly collection of the selected grade in the rating.

These can no longer be maintained as I personally have no longer Bitsight API access.
